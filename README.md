<h1>Apocalypse Farm</h1>
Returning humanity from the brink of extinctionm
<h2>Description</h2>
This is a 3D farming life simulation game inspired by titles like Stardew Valley and Fallout. Players will manage crops, customize their farm, and engage with a dynamic world that evolves based on the players actions and the in game seasonal clock. I co-led this project, designing many of the core systems as well as the overall game concept, including the story and tone.
