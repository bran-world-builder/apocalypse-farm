<h1>Apocalypse Farm</h1>
Returning humanity from the brink of extinction
<h2>Description</h2>
This is a 3D farming life simulation game inspired by titles like Stardew Valley and Fallout. Players will manage crops, customize their farm, and engage with a dynamic world that evolves based on the players actions and the in game seasonal clock. I co-led this project, designing many of the core systems as well as the overall game concept, including the story and tone.
<br />
<h3>Responsibilities & Contributions</h3>
Developed as part of a four-person team, this farming life simulation game was a collaborative effort where each member contributed acros disciplines. While my primary focus was on system and UI/UX design, I also directed the creative vision and story development.<br>
  
  * **UI/UX System - Unity uGUI (Co-Developed)**
     Collaborated with a teammate to design and implement the user interface using Unity's uGUI Toolkit, Text Mesh Pro, and C# scription:
     * Personally focused on secondary inventory interaction, core logic for HUD elements, and input handling
     * Worked closely with the other developer to develop visual heirarchy, dialogue specific UI, and UI styling
     * Helped maintain UI scalability and performance across game views and screen resolutions
  
  * **Grid-Based Object Placement System<br>**
    Created a flexible tile-based placement system:
    * Adapted Unity's 2D Tilemap/Grid system for use in a 3D environment to enable real-time placement of crops, furnitaure, and structures
    * Implemented placement validation, and snap-to-grid feeback
    * Integrated seamlessley with the inventory and farming subsystems
  * **In-Game Clock & Event Framework**
    Built a custom in-game time system that drives nearly all simulation aspects:
    * Time-of-day, seasonal transition, crop grown, and scheduled events
    * Modular, data-driven design to allow other systems to register time-based callbacks
    * Visual feedback via animated clock UI.
  * **Game Manager & Core Architecture**
    Collaborated with a teammate to expand improve the persistent Game Manager to oversee global game state:
    * Handles scene loading/unloading, player session data, and the ever changing game state.
    * Acts as a central hub for coordinating inter-system communication.
  * **Technical Art – Blender + Shader Programming**  
    Created and optimized stylized assets in Blender, including UI props and modular tiles  
    * Wrote custom Unity shaders (ShaderLab/HLSL) for effects like dynamic lighting, and silhouette  
    * Balanced aesthetic fidelity with performance on mid-tier hardware
  * **Creative Direction & Narrative Design**  
    Directed the game’s overall concept, tone, and narrative structure:  
    * Developed the setting, themes, and background lore  
    * Collaborated with the team to align game systems and visual design with narrative goals  
    * Maintained documentation and ensured consistency across features  

### Key Takeaways
* Strengthened technical depth in Unity’s UI, runtime systems, and editor scripting  
* Gained hands-on experience with shader programming and asset workflows  
* Practiced cross-functional collaboration in a small, agile development team  
* Honed leadership and project vision skills through creative direction
